                        <p>This is the assignment which is my first assignment related to Web development as developing
                            website. Viewing the journey of completing my assignment it was much fun to do and also
                            challenges too.
                        <p>
                            Here,in this assignment which contains of
                            homepage,portfolio,contact,report,work experience as building webpages related on it. Here
                            my website layout which i have choose and used a black layout and white which is also one of
                            my
                            favorite color
                            so i choose to start my first assignment with my favorite color.Here the reason i choose a
                            black colour
                            is to make identify about this website as making them importance about it as a powerful
                            website.In
                            addition ,about white colour which i want to represent as a pure and simplicity on this
                            website etc.
                            Talking about fonts which i have choose here is a sans-serif which was normally looking
                            good and understandable fonts while reading as better than other where which i also know
                            this
                            font is a much trending font now.Visualizing and to choose best fonts was also a challenging
                            for me
                            too where when i found sans-serifs which was meeting my expectation level so i choose.
                            Moreover,in this websites i have also utilize of soft grid layout ,flex on it which was
                            little challenging for me
                            ,however i practiced a lot and build a website by adding simple grid layout on the
                            website.Likely,building of website was little challenging however i have completed far
                            enough where maybe it is sufficient as a beginner.</p>
                        <p>In the journey of building my own portfolio as a first assignment i have add some images
                            which i took the refrence from
                            directly a website called <b>UNSPLASH</b> which helped me to get there a realistic images
                            which made my website more
                            good through my opinion.The images i have included there through building a grid layout
                            technique and also mixed with
                            some hover effects on it which can view it.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Hope, i will continue building more
                            website in upcoming assignments as upgrading my skills where building more perfect websites.
                            Likely building this website was not much hard for me as i came from computer science
                            background in a high school where learning this front end code was not much challenging for
                            me so where learning this stuffs which i learned and catch up in my mind very fast. Talking
                            about the features on this project there was one feature hamburger which i input which only
                            can be view in mobile devices browser where clicking there
                            which my navbars used to view on it which was also a good practices as well as a little
                            tough features.Likely this is all about responsive side.
                            The assignment which really helps me to upgrade my fronted skills where after completing
                            this project the level of my confidence
                            boosted positive and as a 2023 batch student i am feeling much refresh and happy to complete
                            this assignment where
                            i hope in the future i will be completing more assignment and also upgrading my front-end
                            kills on it.
