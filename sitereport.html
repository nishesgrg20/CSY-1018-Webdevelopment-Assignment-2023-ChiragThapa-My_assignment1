                        <p>The first web development assignment was creating a website for personal portfolio, which was
                            quite challenging. This assignment includes five pages: A home page, a Portfolio page, a
                            Contact page, Experience Page, and a Site report page which are described below.
                            The website has a black background with white-colored text in sans-serif fonts. It was also
                            challenging to conceptualize and choose the right fonts. The primary intent of using a black
                            background in this instance is to draw attention to this website and convey its value as a
                            potent resource that can be felt immediately. Whereas, the color white represents simplicity
                            and purity. Speaking of sans-serif fonts, they are currently fashionable and commonly loved
                            by web developers, most of them have a respectable visual appeal and are easy to read. These
                            fonts make the sentence easy to read on computer screens. So, this font is used in the
                            overall website to make it eye-pleasing and also it was reaching the expected level of the
                            assignment. At the top of the website, it has a navigation bar which makes it easy to access
                            other pages.</p>

                        <p> The website contains five pages as required. The first page is the home page where a formal
                            introduction is given. The second page of this website is the portfolio page. To provide a
                            fluid viewing experience, there are different photos arranged by using a grid layout the
                            pictures in this project were made utilizing a grid layout technique and some hover effects.
                            Similarly, to this, creating a website was a labor-intensive process, and creating a
                            responsive website proved to be particularly difficult. The biggest issue was while clicking
                            on the hamburger icon that appears from the top of the head in the navigation bar. The issue
                            was that the width was not automatically adjusting while viewing on mobile devices. It was
                            likely discovered via research and practice that if position property in CSS could be used,
                            the problem could be solved with ease.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Hopefully, it was solved by blocking the display on mobile screens. After, creating the
                            entire website which was quite engaging and challenging. Overall, It was a wonderful
                            experience.
