                        <p>This assignment is the first one that has to do with creating websites for the Web.
                            It was both enjoyable and challenging to complete this project, in my opinion.
                            This assignment includes a homepage, portfolio, contact information, report, and job
                            experience as well as the creation of webpages that are relevant to it.

                            the white text on a black background website design.

                            The primary intent of using a black background in this instance is to draw attention to this
                            website and convey its value as a potent resource that can be felt immediately.

                            Perhaps, regarding the color white, which on this website is known to signify purity and
                            simplicity, etc.

                            Speaking of sans-serif fonts, which are currently fashionable and the most generally used
                            types, most of them have a respectable visual appeal and are simple to read.

                            This is a fact that these fonts are considerably simpler to read on a
                            computer screen, which is another significant component in their appeal.

                            The font family has been put to the footer section along with a link to Google's fonts and
                            icons.

                            It was also challenging to conceptualize and choose the right fonts.

                            too where this fonts sans-serifs which was reaching the expectation level of the assignment
                            which has been
                            selected.

                        <p>As the first project, creating a portfolio website was required.
                            As part of that procedure, uploaded a few photos that had been taken and immediately taken
                            from the website <b>UNSPLASH WEBSITE</b>, which helped in the development of realistic images
                            that enhanced the quality of this website.

                            To provide a fluid viewing experience, the pictures in this project were made utilizing a
                            grid layout technique and some hover effects.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Similar to this, creating a website was a labor-intensive process, and creating a responsive website proved to be particularly difficult.
                            The biggest issue was when you clicked on the hamburger that appears from the top of the head in the navbar.
                            The issue was that the width wasn't automatically adjusting, which was a major problem while viewing on mobile devices.
                            It was likely discovered via research and practice that if position property in CSS could be used, the problem could be solved with ease.
                            Hopefully that which has been managed the responding one-by-one, which may not be enough good but has been improved. 
                        </p>
                        <p>After all, creating entire websites was quite engaging and challenging too, 
                            Similarly, everyone has to have the abilities on this course because of how popular it is in universities and how many employment it can lead to.
                            It is also true that university students should give more difficult assignments that will undoubtedly aid to strengthen their more Front-end related skills.
