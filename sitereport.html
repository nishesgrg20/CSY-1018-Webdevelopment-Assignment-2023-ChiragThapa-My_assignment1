                        <p>This assignment is the first one that has to do with creating websites for the Web.
                            It was both enjoyable and challenging to complete this project, in my opinion.
                        <p>
                            This assignment includes a homepage, portfolio, contact information, report, and job
                            experience as well as the creation of webpages that are relevant to it.

                            the white text on a black background website design.

                            The primary intent of using a black background in this instance is to draw attention to this
                            website and convey its value as a potent resource that can be felt immediately.

                            Perhaps, regarding the color white, which on this website is known to signify purity and
                            simplicity, etc.

                            Speaking of sans-serif fonts, which are currently fashionable and the most generally used
                            types, most of them have a respectable visual appeal and are simple to read.

                            We are probably all aware of the fact that these fonts are considerably simpler to read on a
                            computer screen, which is another significant component in their appeal.

                            The font family has been put to the footer section along with a link to Google's fonts and
                            icons.

                            It was also challenging to conceptualize and choose the right fonts.

                            too where when I found sans-serifs which was reaching my expectation level thus I selected.


                        </p>

                        <p>As my first project, I had to develop a portfolio. As part of that process, I uploaded
                            certain photographs that I directly referenced from the website <b>UNSPLASH WEBSITE</b>,
                            which
                            assisted in the creation of realistic images that improved the quality of this website.
                            The photographs in this project were created using a grid layout technique and some hover
                            effects to enable a fluid viewing experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            As I improve my talents and construct more ideal websites, I intend to continue creating
                            additional websites for prospective tasks.

                            Because I studied computer science in high school and have a background in that field, it
                            was probably not too difficult for me to develop this website because I picked up the front
                            end coding quickly and did not find it particularly difficult to learn.
                            Speaking of the features on this project, there was one that I added the hamburger that
                            could only be viewed in mobile device browsers, where clicking there caused my navbar to
                            display on it. This feature was both a good practice and a little difficult to utilize.
                            Likely this is all about responding side.
                            The assignment which really helps me to upgrade my fronted skills where after completing
                            this project the level of my confidence boosted positive and as a 2023 batch student I am
                            feeling much refresh and happy to complete this assignment where's I hope in the future I
                            will be completing more assignment and also upgrading my front-end skills on it.
