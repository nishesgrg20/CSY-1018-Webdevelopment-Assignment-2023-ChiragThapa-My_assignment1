                        <p>This is the assignment which is a first assignment related to Web development as developing
                            website. Viewing the journey of completing this assignment it was much fun to do and also
                            challenges too.
                        <p>
                            Here,in this assignment which contains of
                            homepage,portfolio,contact,report,work experience as building webpages related on it.
                          The website layout which has black layout and white.Here the main reason to choose a
                            black colour is to make identify about this website as making them importance about it as a powerful
                            website which can be feel in one sight.Likely,about white colour which we know it represent as a pure and simplicity on this
                            website etc.
                            Talking about fonts  sans-serif which was normally looking
                            good and understandable fonts while reading it where which is also 
                            trending  and most popular fonts in these days.Likey,we know that this fonts is much easily readable fonts in digital
                            screen which can be also main reason to be one of the major choices.
                            Visualizing and to choose best fonts was also a good challenging.                            too where when i found sans-serifs which was meeting my expectation level so i choose.
                            Moreover,in this websites there is a utilize of soft grid layout ,flex on it which was
                            little challenging for me</p>
            
                        <p>In the journey of building portfolio as a first assignment, added some images
                            which has been took the refrence from
                            directly a website called <b>UNSPLASH</b> which helped  to get there a realistic images
                            which made this website more
                            good.The images in this project has been build through grid layout technique and
                            some hover effects on it which can view it smoothly.
                        </p>
                        <p>

                            Hope, i will continue building more
                            website in upcoming assignments as upgrading my skills where building more perfect websites.
                            Likely building this website was not much hard for me as i came from computer science
                            background in a high school where learning this front end code was not much challenging for
                            me so where learning this stuffs which i learned and catch up in my mind very fast. Talking
                            about the features on this project there was one feature hamburger which i input which only
                            can be view in mobile devices browser where clicking there
                            which my navbars used to view on it which was also a good practices as well as a little
                            tough features.Likely this is all about responsive side.
                            The assignment which really helps me to upgrade my fronted skills where after completing
                            this project the level of my confidence
                            boosted positive and as a 2023 batch student i am feeling much refresh and happy to complete
                            this assignment where
                            i hope in the future i will be completing more assignment and also upgrading my front-end
                            kills on it.
